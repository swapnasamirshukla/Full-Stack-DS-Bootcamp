    "\n",
    "An artificial neuron, often referred to as a perceptron, is a fundamental building block of artificial neural networks. Its structure is inspired by biological neurons, though simplified. An artificial neuron consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inputs:** Each neuron receives input signals from other neurons or external sources.\n",
    "- **Weights:** Each input is associated with a weight, indicating its importance in the neuron's decision-making process.\n",
    "- **Summation Function:** The weighted inputs are summed together, typically using a linear combination.\n",
    "- **Activation Function:** The sum is then passed through an activation function, which determines the output of the neuron. It introduces non-linearity to the model.\n",
    "- **Bias:** An optional bias term can be added to the summation before applying the activation function.\n",
    "- **Output:** The output of the neuron, after the activation function, is propagated to other neurons in the network.\n",
