    "**Q1. What is a probability distribution, exactly? If the values are meant to be random, how can you predict them at all?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A probability distribution is a mathematical function that describes the likelihood of different outcomes in a random experiment or process. While the individual values in a probability distribution are inherently unpredictable, the distribution itself provides insights into the likelihood of different outcomes based on their probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. Is there a distinction between true random numbers and pseudo-random numbers, if there is one? Why are the latter considered “good enough”?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, there is a distinction. True random numbers are generated from a genuinely random source, like atmospheric noise. Pseudo-random numbers are generated using deterministic algorithms that appear random, but are based on a seed value. While they are not truly random, pseudo-random numbers are considered \"good enough\" for many applications because they exhibit statistical properties similar to true random numbers and are computationally efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. What are the two main factors that influence the behavior of a \"normal\" probability distribution?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main factors that influence the behavior of a normal probability distribution are its mean (average) and standard deviation. The mean determines the central location of the distribution, while the standard deviation determines its spread or variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. Provide a real-life example of a normal distribution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "One real-life example of a normal distribution is human height. In a population, the distribution of heights tends to follow a bell-shaped curve, with most people falling around the average height and fewer people at the extremes (very tall or very short).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. In the short term, how can you expect a probability distribution to behave? What do you think will happen as the number of trials grows?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the short term, the behavior of a probability distribution can be unpredictable due to the randomness of individual outcomes. However, as the number of trials increases, the distribution's characteristics become more pronounced and follow the expected probabilities more closely, resulting in a convergence to the theoretical distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. What kind of object can be shuffled by using random.shuffle?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `random.shuffle()` function in Python can shuffle a mutable sequence object like a list. It modifies the sequence in place by changing the order of its elements randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. Describe the math package's general categories of functions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `math` package in Python provides functions for mathematical operations. Its general categories of functions include basic arithmetic functions, trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, exponentiation functions, and more advanced functions like those for factorials and statistical calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q8. What is the relationship between exponentiation and logarithms?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Exponentiation and logarithms are inverse operations. If `a` raised to the power of `b` equals `c` (a^b = c), then the logarithm base `a` of `c` is equal to `b` (log_a(c) = b).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q9. What are the three logarithmic functions that Python supports?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports three logarithmic functions:\n",
    "1. `math.log(x)`: Natural logarithm (base `e`) of `x`.\n",
    "2. `math.log10(x)`: Common logarithm (base 10) of `x`.\n",
    "3. `math.log(x, base)`: Logarithm of `x` with a specified base."
