    "**Q1. What is the purpose of the try statement?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the `try` statement in Python is to define a block of code where exceptions might occur. It allows you to catch and handle exceptions that may be raised within the block, preventing the program from crashing and allowing for graceful error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. What are the two most popular try statement variations?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The two most popular variations of the `try` statement are:\n",
    "1. **try-except:** This variation catches specific exceptions that might be raised within the `try` block and specifies code to handle each exception in corresponding `except` blocks.\n",
    "2. **try-finally:** This variation ensures that the code in the `finally` block is executed regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It's useful for cleanup operations like closing files, releasing resources, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. What is the purpose of the raise statement?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `raise` statement is used to explicitly raise an exception in Python. It allows you to trigger exceptions in your code manually. You can provide an exception type or an instance of an exception class, optionally with an associated error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. What does the assert statement do, and what other statement is it like?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `assert` statement is used to test if a given condition is `True`. If the condition is `False`, an `AssertionError` exception is raised. It's used for debugging and checking assumptions during development. The `assert` statement is somewhat similar to exception handling using `try` and `except`, but it's specifically used to validate conditions that should always hold true, while exceptions are for handling unexpected situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. What is the purpose of the with/as argument, and what other statement is it like?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `with/as` statement is used for context management, allowing you to ensure that resources are properly managed and released after they are no longer needed. It's particularly useful for working with files, sockets, and other resources that need to be closed or cleaned up. The `with` statement is similar to a `try-finally` block but provides a more elegant syntax for managing resources and automatically cleaning up after use."
