    "**Q1. What is the difference between `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__getattr__`: This method is called when an attribute that doesn't exist is accessed. It's a \"fallback\" method to dynamically create or fetch attributes that are not present.\n",
    "- `__getattribute__`: This method is called for every attribute access, whether the attribute exists or not. It's used to customize attribute access at a lower level and is more powerful but must be used with caution to avoid infinite recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. What is the difference between properties and descriptors?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Properties:** Properties are a built-in way to control access to instance attributes. They allow you to define custom behavior for attribute access and modification, while still using the syntax of regular attribute access.\n",
    "- **Descriptors:** Descriptors are a more general mechanism for attribute access control. They allow you to define how attribute access is handled by providing the `__get__`, `__set__`, and `__delete__` methods. Descriptors can be used for more advanced customization of attribute behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. What are the key differences in functionality between `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__`, as well as properties and descriptors?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__getattr__` vs. `__getattribute__`:\n",
    "  - `__getattr__` is called when the attribute doesn't exist.\n",
    "  - `__getattribute__` is called for all attribute accesses.\n",
    "- Properties vs. Descriptors:\n",
    "  - Properties are a higher-level, simpler way to control attribute access.\n",
    "  - Descriptors provide more fine-grained control and can affect multiple attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that while properties and descriptors are more commonly used for attribute customization, `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__` should be used with care due to their potential to introduce unexpected behavior or even infinite loops."
