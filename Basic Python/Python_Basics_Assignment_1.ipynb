    "**2. Question: What is the difference between a string and a variable?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: A string is a sequence of characters, usually used to represent\n",
    "text, enclosed within single (' ') or double (\" \") quotation marks. A\n",
    "variable, on the other hand, is a symbolic name used to store a value or\n",
    "an object in programming. It provides a way to refer to and manipulate\n",
    "data by using a chosen identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Question: Describe three different data types.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Three different data types in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Integer: Represents whole numbers without decimal points, e.g.,\n",
    "\\`5\\`, \\`-10\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Float: Represents numbers with decimal points, e.g., \\`3.14\\`,\n",
    "\\`-0.5\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- String: Represents text or a sequence of characters, e.g.,\n",
    "\\`'hello'\\`, \\`\"Python\"\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Question: What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions\n",
    "do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: An expression is made up of values, variables, operators, and\n",
    "function calls that can be evaluated to produce a result. All\n",
    "expressions produce a value, and they can represent computations or\n",
    "operations that manipulate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Question: What is the difference between an expression and a\n",
    "statement?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: An expression produces a value when evaluated and can be used\n",
    "within larger expressions or statements. A statement, on the other hand,\n",
    "is a complete instruction in a program that performs an action or\n",
    "operation. Statements don't necessarily produce values, but they can\n",
    "change the state of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Question: After running the following code, what does the variable\n",
    "\\`bacon\\` contain?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**bacon = 22**\n",
    "\n",
    "**bacon + 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The variable \\`bacon\\` will still contain the value \\`22\\`. The\n",
    "expression \\`bacon + 1\\` is evaluated, but its result isn't assigned to\n",
    "any variable, so it doesn't modify the value of \\`bacon\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Question: What should the values of the following two terms be?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**- \\`'spam' + 'spamspam'\\`**\n",
    "\n",
    "**- \\`'spam' \\* 3\\`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- \\`'spam' + 'spamspam'\\` will result in \\`'spamspamspam'\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- \\`'spam' \\* 3\\` will result in \\`'spamspamspam'\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Question: Why is \\`eggs\\` a valid variable name while \\`100\\` is\n",
    "invalid?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: In Python, variable names must follow certain rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- They can only start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (\\_).\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- After the first character, they can also contain numbers (0-9).\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- \\`eggs\\` follows these rules and is a valid variable name, whereas\n",
    "\\`100\\` starts with a number, which is not allowed for variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. Question: What three functions can be used to get the integer,\n",
    "floating-point number, or string version of a value?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- \\`int()\\`: Converts a value to an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- \\`float()\\`: Converts a value to a floating-point number.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- \\`str()\\`: Converts a value to a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. Question: Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix\n",
    "it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The expression causes an error because you're trying to\n",
    "concatenate a string (\\`'I have eaten '\\`) with an integer (\\`99\\`) and\n",
    "another string (\\`' burritos.'\\`). To fix it, you need to ensure that\n",
    "all parts being concatenated are of the same data type (string). You can\n",
    "achieve this by converting the integer \\`99\\` to a string using the\n",
    "\\`str()\\` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'"
