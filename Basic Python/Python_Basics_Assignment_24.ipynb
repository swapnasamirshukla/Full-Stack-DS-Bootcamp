    "### 1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `def` statements and `lambda` expressions are used for defining functions in Python. However, there are key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `def` is used to define standard functions with a name, and it can contain multiple lines of code, including conditionals, loops, etc.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def add(a, b):\n",
    "      return a + b\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "- `lambda` is used to define small, anonymous, inline functions in a single line. They are limited to a single expression and do not have a name unless assigned to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  add = lambda a, b: a + b\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What is the benefit of lambda?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conciseness: `lambda` functions can be defined inline, making the code shorter and possibly clearer.\n",
    "- Anonymity: `lambda` functions are anonymous, useful for quick, throwaway functionality.\n",
    "- Functional Programming: They are often used in functional programming constructs like `map`, `filter`, `sort`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Compare and contrast map, filter, and reduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `map`: Takes a function and an iterable as arguments, applies the function to each item in the iterable, and returns an iterator with the transformed items. It affects all items in the iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  squares = map(lambda x: x*x, [1, 2, 3])  # [1, 4, 9]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `filter`: Takes a function and an iterable, applies the function to each item, and returns an iterator containing only the items for which the function returned `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  even = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, [1, 2, 3, 4])  # [2, 4]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `reduce`: Takes a function and an iterable, applies the function cumulatively to the items, and returns a single reduced value. Part of the `functools` library in Python 3.x.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from functools import reduce\n",
    "  sum = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, [1, 2, 3, 4])  # 10\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. What are function annotations, and how are they used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Function annotations provide a way to attach metadata to a function's parameters and return value, which can be useful for documentation or type checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `: int` is an annotation indicating that the function expects integers as arguments, and `-> int` indicates it will return an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What are recursive functions, and how are they used?\n",
    "\n",
    "A recursive function is a function that calls itself during its execution. They are often used to solve problems that can be broken down into simpler sub-problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Calculating the factorial of a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def factorial(n):\n",
    "    if n == 1:\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return n * factorial(n-1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. What are some general design guidelines for coding functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Single Responsibility: Each function should do one thing well.\n",
    "- Descriptive Names: Use clear, descriptive names for functions.\n",
    "- Short Length: Functions should generally be short and easily readable.\n",
    "- Parameter Limits: Limit the number of parameters to a few, ideally less than 5.\n",
    "- Return Values: Be clear about what the function returns.\n",
    "- Documentation: Use docstrings to describe what the function does, its parameters, and its return value.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Name three or more ways that functions can communicate results to a caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `return`: Functions can return values directly to the caller.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def add(a, b):\n",
    "      return a + b\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Side-effects: Functions can modify the state of mutable arguments or external variables.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def modify_list(my_list):\n",
    "      my_list.append(\"new item\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Exceptions: Functions can raise exceptions to indicate errors or special conditions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def divide(a, b):\n",
    "      if b == 0:\n",
    "          raise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",
    "      return a / b\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Callbacks: Functions can accept function arguments (callbacks) and call them to pass back information.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def process_data(data, callback):\n",
    "      result = perform_operation(data)\n",
    "      callback(result)\n",
    "  ```"
