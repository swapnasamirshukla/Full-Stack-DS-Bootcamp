    "### 1. What is the difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets and parentheses?\n",
    "\n",
    "Enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets `[]` creates a list and populates it immediately with the elements specified in the list comprehension. It consumes memory proportional to the size of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "squares = [x*x for x in range(5)]  # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Enclosing it in parentheses `()` creates a generator expression. This doesn't evaluate all the elements immediately but rather produces them on-the-fly during iteration. It is memory-efficient for large sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "squares = (x*x for x in range(5))  # <generator object at some memory location>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What is the relationship between generators and iterators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators are a type of iterator, but they are easier to write and more memory-efficient. An iterator requires implementing methods like `__iter__()` and `__next__()`, while a generator automatically implements these methods. With a generator, you use the `yield` keyword to yield values one at a time. When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object without even beginning execution, and the function only executes on `__next__()` calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What are the signs that a function is a generator function?\n",
    "\n",
    "A generator function is defined like a normal function but contains one or more `yield` statements. When called, it returns a generator object, but no code within the body of the function is executed immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_generator():\n",
    "    yield 1\n",
    "    yield 2\n",
    "    yield 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. What is the purpose of a yield statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `yield` statement is used in Python to define a generator. It replaces the `return` of a function to provide a result to its caller without destroying local variables. Once the function is paused and the output is returned to the caller, the local variables are preserved, and the function can be resumed right from where it was paused, allowing the function to yield multiple values over its lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and contrast between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `map`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It applies a function to all items in an input list.\n",
    "- Returns an iterator that yields the transformed elements.\n",
    "- Syntax: `map(function_to_apply, list_of_inputs)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "squares = map(lambda x: x*x, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### List Comprehension:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A more Pythonic way to generate a list based on existing iterables.\n",
    "- Immediately creates a list, consuming memory proportional to list size.\n",
    "- Syntax: `[expression for item in iterable]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "squares = [x*x for x in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both can apply a function to a list of elements.\n",
    "- Both can use a condition to filter elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Contrast:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `map` returns an iterator, whereas list comprehension returns a list.\n",
    "- List comprehensions are generally more concise and easier to read.\n",
    "- `map` can be more memory-efficient for large sequences since it evaluates elements lazily."
