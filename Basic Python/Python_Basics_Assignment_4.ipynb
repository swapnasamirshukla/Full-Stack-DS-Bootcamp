    "1. **What exactly is `[]`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** `[]` represents an empty list in Python. It's a data structure that can hold a collection of values, separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **In a list of values stored in a variable called `spam`, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** You can assign the value 'hello' as the third value in the list `spam` using indexing:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   spam[2] = 'hello'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What is the value of `spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** The value of this expression is `'d'`, as `int('3' * 2)` is `33`, and `33 / 11` is `3`. Index `3` in the list `spam` corresponds to the value `'d'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What is the value of `spam[-1]`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** The value of `spam[-1]` is `'d'`, which is the last value in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What is the value of `spam[:2]`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** The value of `spam[:2]` is `['a', 'b']`, which is a sublist containing the first two values in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **What is the value of `bacon.index('cat')`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** The value of `bacon.index('cat')` is `1`, as the first occurrence of `'cat'` is at index `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **How does `bacon.append(99)` change the look of the list value in bacon?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** After `bacon.append(99)`, the list `bacon` will become `[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]` with `99` appended to the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **How does `bacon.remove('cat')` change the look of the list in bacon?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** After `bacon.remove('cat')`, the list `bacon` will become `[3.14, 11, 'cat', True]` with the first occurrence of `'cat'` removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** The list concatenation operator is `+`, which combines two lists into one. The list replication operator is `*`, which replicates a list a specified number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **What is the difference between the list methods `append()` and `insert()`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Answer:** The `append()` method adds an item to the end of the list, while the `insert()` method adds an item at a specific index in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **What are the two methods for removing items from a list?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Answer:** The two methods for removing items from a list are `remove()` (removes the first occurrence of a value) and `pop()` (removes an item at a specific index and returns its value).\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Describe how list values and string values are identical.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Answer:** Both list values and string values are sequences of items in Python. They support indexing, slicing, and various operations like concatenation and replication.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **What's the difference between tuples and lists?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Answer:** Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation. Lists are mutable, allowing for modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Answer:** You can create a tuple with a single element using a trailing comma:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    my_tuple = (42,)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Answer:** You can convert a list to a tuple using the `tuple()` function, and a tuple to a list using the `list()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Answer:** Variables that \"contain\" list values store references to the actual list objects in memory, rather than containing the list values directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **How do you distinguish between `copy.copy()` and `copy.deepcopy()`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Answer:** `copy.copy()` and `copy.deepcopy()` are functions provided by the `copy` module in Python that are used to create copies of objects. The key difference between them lies in how they handle nested objects and their impact on the retained values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`copy.copy()`**:\n",
    "- When you use `copy.copy()`, it creates a shallow copy of the object. This means that a new object is created, but the nested objects within the copied object are still references to the same objects as those in the original.\n",
    "- The top-level object is duplicated, but the lower-level objects are not. Changes made to the nested objects in the copy will be reflected in the original and vice versa.\n",
    "- Shallow copies retain references to the original objects, which can lead to unintended changes if you modify nested objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`copy.deepcopy()`**:\n",
    "- When you use `copy.deepcopy()`, it creates a deep copy of the object. This means that not only is a new object created, but all the nested objects are also recursively duplicated.\n",
    "- Both the top-level and nested objects are duplicated, resulting in a completely independent copy. Changes to the nested objects in the copy will not affect the original.\n",
    "- Deep copies ensure that the copied object is completely separate from the original, preventing unintended changes from propagating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the difference:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import copy\n",
    "\n",
    "original_list = [1, [2, 3]]\n",
    "shallow_copy = copy.copy(original_list)\n",
    "deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(original_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modify the nested list in each copy\n",
    "shallow_copy[1][0] = 99\n",
    "deep_copy[1][0] = 88\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Original:\", original_list)   # Output: Original: [1, [99, 3]]\n",
    "print(\"Shallow Copy:\", shallow_copy) # Output: Shallow Copy: [1, [99, 3]]\n",
    "print(\"Deep Copy:\", deep_copy)       # Output: Deep Copy: [1, [88, 3]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, you can see that changes made to the nested list in the shallow copy affect the original list, while changes made to the nested list in the deep copy do not affect the original. This demonstrates the difference in terms of retaining values between `copy.copy()` and `copy.deepcopy()`."
