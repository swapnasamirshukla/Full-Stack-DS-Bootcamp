    "1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?\n",
    "The feature responsible for generating Regex objects is the `re` module in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "Raw strings (denoted by the `r` prefix) are often used in Regex objects to prevent Python's string escaping mechanism from interfering with the regular expression pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the return value of the search() method?\n",
    "The `search()` method returns a match object if the pattern is found in the searched string. If no match is found, it returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
    "You can use the `.group()` method with an argument to get the actual strings that match the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In the regex which created from the r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)', what does group zero cover? Group 2? Group 1?\n",
    "Group 0 covers the entire matched string. Group 1 covers the first set of three digits, and Group 2 covers the second hyphenated set.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?\n",
    "To match literal parentheses and periods in a regex pattern, you need to escape them using a backslash.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of the two options?\n",
    "If the regex pattern contains capturing groups, `findall()` returns a list of tuples where each tuple contains the captured groups; otherwise, it returns a list of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?\n",
    "In standard expressions, the `|` character means \"OR,\" allowing you to match either the expression on its left or the expression on its right.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. In regular expressions, what does the character . stand for?\n",
    "In regular expressions, the `.` character (dot) stands for any character except a newline.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?\n",
    "In regular expressions, `+` matches one or more occurrences of the preceding element, while `*` matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding element.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?\n",
    "`{4}` specifies that the preceding element should appear exactly 4 times, whereas `{4,5}` specifies that the preceding element should appear between 4 and 5 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What do you mean by the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "In regular expressions, `\\d` represents a digit (0-9), `\\w` represents a word character (alphanumeric and underscore), and `\\s` represents a whitespace character.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What do \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "In regular expressions, `\\D` represents a non-digit, `\\W` represents a non-word character, and `\\S` represents a non-whitespace character.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the difference between .*? and .*?\n",
    "`.*?` is a non-greedy match that matches as few characters as possible, while `.*` is a greedy match that matches as many characters as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. What is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class?\n",
    "The syntax is `[0-9a-z]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. What is the procedure for making a normal expression in regex case insensitive?\n",
    "To make a normal expression case-insensitive, you can pass the `re.IGNORECASE` flag as the second argument to the `re.compile()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as the 2nd argument in re.compile()?\n",
    "The `.` character normally matches any character except a newline. If `re.DOTALL` is passed as the second argument in `re.compile()`, then the `.` character will match any character, including newlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. If numReg = re.compile(r'\\d+'), what will numRegex.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hens') return?\n",
    "It will return `'X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hens'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. What does passing re.VERBOSE as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allow you to do?\n",
    "Passing `re.VERBOSE` as the second argument to `re.compile()` allows you to write more readable regular expressions by ignoring whitespace and adding comments using the `#` symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. How would you write a regex that matches numbers with commas for every three digits but not certain cases?\n",
    "The regex: `r'^\\d{1,3}(,\\d{3})*$'` would match numbers with commas for every three digits, excluding cases like '12,34,567' and '1234'.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. How would you write a regex to match a full name with the last name \"Watanabe\" under certain conditions?\n",
    "The regex: `r'[A-Z][a-z]* Watanabe'` would match a full name with the last name \"Watanabe\" where the first name starts with a capital letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. How would you write a regex to match specific sentence patterns while ignoring case?\n",
    "The regex: `r'(Alice|Bob|Carol) (eats|pets|throws) (apples|cats|baseballs)\\.'` with the `re.IGNORECASE` flag would match specified sentence patterns."
