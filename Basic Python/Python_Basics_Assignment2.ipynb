    "1. **What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?**\n",
    "   - The two values of the Boolean data type are **True** and **False**. They are written exactly as shown here.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What are the three different types of Boolean operators?**\n",
    "   - The three different types of Boolean operators are **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables:**\n",
    "   - **AND Truth Table**:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     True AND True   => True\n",
    "     True AND False  => False\n",
    "     False AND True  => False\n",
    "     False AND False => False\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **OR Truth Table**:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     True OR True    => True\n",
    "     True OR False   => True\n",
    "     False OR True   => True\n",
    "     False OR False  => False\n",
    "     ```\n",

    "   - **NOT Truth Table**:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     NOT True  => False\n",
    "     NOT False => True\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What are the values of the following expressions?**\n",
    "   - (5 > 4) and (3 == 5) => False\n",
    "   - not (5 > 4) => False\n",
    "   - (5 > 4) or (3 == 5) => True\n",
    "   - not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) => False\n",
    "   - (True and True) and (True == False) => False\n",
    "   - (not False) or (not True) => True\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What are the six comparison operators?**\n",
    "   - The six comparison operators are:\n",
    "     - Equal to (==)\n",
    "     - Not equal to (!=)\n",
    "     - Greater than (>)\n",
    "     - Less than (<)\n",
    "     - Greater than or equal to (>=)\n",
    "     - Less than or equal to (<=)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators? Describe a condition and when you would use one.**\n",
    "   - The equal to operator (`==`) is used to compare two values for equality. For example: `if x == 10:` would check if the value of `x` is equal to 10.\n",
    "   - The assignment operator (`=`) is used to assign a value to a variable. For example: `x = 10` assigns the value 10 to the variable `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Identify the three blocks in this code:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   spam = 0\n",
    "   if spam == 10:\n",
    "       print('eggs')\n",
    "   if spam > 5:\n",
    "       print('bacon')\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       print('ham')\n",
    "   print('spam')\n",
    "   print('spam')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   The three blocks are:\n",
    "   1. The first `if` block: `if spam == 10:`\n",
    "   2. The second `if` block: `if spam > 5:`\n",
    "   3. The `else` block: `else:`\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if spam == 1:\n",
    "       print('Hello')\n",
    "   elif spam == 2:\n",
    "       print('Howdy')\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       print('Greetings!')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **If your program is stuck in an endless loop, what keys will you press?**\n",
    "   - You can typically press **Ctrl+C** to interrupt the program and break out of the endless loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **How can you tell the difference between break and continue?**\n",
    "    - `break` is used to exit the current loop completely.\n",
    "    - `continue` is used to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?**\n",
    "    - `range(10)` generates numbers from 0 to 9 (10 numbers in total).\n",
    "    - `range(0, 10)` is equivalent to `range(10)`.\n",
    "    - `range(0, 10, 1)` is also equivalent to `range(10)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program using a while loop.**\n",
    "    - Using a for loop:\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      for i in range(1, 11):\n",
    "          print(i)\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Using a while loop:\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      i = 1\n",
    "      while i <= 10:\n",
    "          print(i)\n",
    "          i += 1\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import spam\n",
    "    spam.bacon()\n",
    "    ```\n"
