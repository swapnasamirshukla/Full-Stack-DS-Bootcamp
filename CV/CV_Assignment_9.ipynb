    "**1. What are the advantages of a CNN for image classification over a completely linked DNN?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have several advantages over fully connected Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for image classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameter Sharing**: A feature detector (like a kernel or filter) in CNNs learns a specific feature and can be applied across the entire image. This drastically reduces the number of parameters, making the model more efficient and less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Spatial Hierarchies**: CNNs inherently recognize spatial hierarchies in data. Lower layers might detect edges, while deeper layers might detect more complex structures. This hierarchical feature extraction isn't present in regular DNNs.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Translation Invariance**: Once a CNN learns a feature in one part of an image, it can recognize it in any other part. This property is extremely beneficial for image data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Reduced Computational Needs**: Due to pooling and shared parameters, CNNs often require fewer computational resources than DNNs for equivalent tasks.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Better Handling of Image Data**: CNNs handle varying image sizes better than DNNs, which require a fixed input size."

    "**3. What are five things you might do to fix the problem if your GPU runs out of memory while training a CNN?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reduce Batch Size**: One of the most straightforward methods to reduce GPU memory consumption is to decrease the batch size.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Gradient Accumulation**: Instead of updating weights after every small batch, gradients are accumulated over multiple small batches and updated less frequently.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Model Pruning**: This involves removing neurons or entire layers that contribute little to the final prediction, reducing the model's size.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Use Checkpoints**: Save model weights periodically and clear GPU memory, then resume training from the last checkpoint.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Model Quantization**: This process reduces the precision of the model's parameters, which can save memory without significant loss in performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Why would you use a max pooling layer instead of a convolutional layer with the same stride?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Max pooling layers are used to downsample the spatial dimensions of the input, reducing the computational burden and number of parameters. Advantages include:\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Parameter Reduction**: Unlike convolutional layers, max pooling doesn't introduce new parameters.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Translation Invariance**: Max pooling can make the model more robust to slight translations or distortions in the input.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Reduction in Spatial Dimensions**: This can help to focus on the most important features in the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. When would a local response normalization layer be useful?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Local Response Normalization (LRN) layers were once popular in the early days of CNNs. They normalize neuron activities in a way that promotes lateral inhibition, emphasizing some activation over others. They can be useful:\n",
    "  \n",
    "- When trying to make the activations of a neuron relative to its neighboring neurons.\n",
    "- In scenarios where the model is overfitting, as normalization can introduce a form of regularization.\n",
    "  \n",
    "However, it's worth noting that LRN has become less popular with the advent of Batch Normalization, which normalizes neuron activities across batches and has proven to be more effective in many cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. In comparison to LeNet-5, what are the main innovations in AlexNet? What about GoogLeNet and ResNet's core innovations?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AlexNet**:\n",
    "  - Deeper architecture with more layers.\n",

    "  - GPU implementation to handle the increased computational demand.\n",

    "- **GoogLeNet**:\n",
    "  - Introduction of the \"Inception\" module, which allows the network to choose between various convolutional kernel sizes and pooling operations.\n",
    "  - Use of 1x1 convolutions to reduce the number of parameters.\n",
    "  - No use of fully connected layers, thus reducing parameters.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **ResNet**:\n",
    "  - Introduction of \"skip connections\" or \"residual connections\" to allow gradients to flow through the network, mitigating the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks.\n",
