    "**1. What are the advantages of a CNN for image classification over a completely linked DNN?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have several advantages over fully connected Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for image classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameter Sharing**: A feature detector (like a kernel or filter) in CNNs learns a specific feature and can be applied across the entire image. This drastically reduces the number of parameters, making the model more efficient and less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Spatial Hierarchies**: CNNs inherently recognize spatial hierarchies in data. Lower layers might detect edges, while deeper layers might detect more complex structures. This hierarchical feature extraction isn't present in regular DNNs.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Translation Invariance**: Once a CNN learns a feature in one part of an image, it can recognize it in any other part. This property is extremely beneficial for image data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Reduced Computational Needs**: Due to pooling and shared parameters, CNNs often require fewer computational resources than DNNs for equivalent tasks.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Better Handling of Image Data**: CNNs handle varying image sizes better than DNNs, which require a fixed input size."

    "\n",
    "- **Reduce Batch Size**: One of the most straightforward methods to reduce GPU memory consumption is to decrease the batch size.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Gradient Accumulation**: Instead of updating weights after every small batch, gradients are accumulated over multiple small batches and updated less frequently.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Model Pruning**: This involves removing neurons or entire layers that contribute little to the final prediction, reducing the model's size.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Use Checkpoints**: Save model weights periodically and clear GPU memory, then resume training from the last checkpoint.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Model Quantization**: This process reduces the precision of the model's parameters, which can save memory without significant loss in performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Why would you use a max pooling layer instead of a convolutional layer with the same stride?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Max pooling layers are used to downsample the spatial dimensions of the input, reducing the computational burden and number of parameters. Advantages include:\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Parameter Reduction**: Unlike convolutional layers, max pooling doesn't introduce new parameters.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Translation Invariance**: Max pooling can make the model more robust to slight translations or distortions in the input.\n",

    "**5. When would a local response normalization layer be useful?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Local Response Normalization (LRN) layers were once popular in the early days of CNNs. They normalize neuron activities in a way that promotes lateral inhibition, emphasizing some activation over others. They can be useful:\n",
    "  \n",
    "- When trying to make the activations of a neuron relative to its neighboring neurons.\n",
    "- In scenarios where the model is overfitting, as normalization can introduce a form of regularization.\n",
    "  \n",
