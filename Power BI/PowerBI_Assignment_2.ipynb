    "### Question: Explain the advantages of Natural Queries in PowerBI with an example?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Queries in Power BI refer to the use of natural language for querying data models, generally through Q&A features. This makes data analytics accessible to business users who may not be familiar with query languages like SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ease of Use**: Users can ask questions in natural language instead of learning a specific query language.\n",
    "2. **Speed**: Quick answers without needing to sift through multiple tables and charts.\n",
    "3. **Accessibility**: Makes data querying accessible to a broader audience.\n",
    "4. **Flexibility**: Users can ask iterative questions based on previous answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of creating a complex SQL query to find \"Total Sales in 2020,\" a user can simply type, \"What were the total sales in 2020?\" and Power BI will provide the answer.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Question: Explain Back End cluster from Power BI Service Architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Back End cluster in Power BI Service Architecture handles the core data operations. This includes querying data models, data storage, and rendering visuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Querying**: Executes queries against data models.\n",
    "2. **Data Storage**: Manages data storage solutions like Azure Blob Storage for cached data.\n",
    "3. **Rendering**: Produces visualizations based on user requests.\n",
