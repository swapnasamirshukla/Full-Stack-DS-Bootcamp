    "**Question**: Create a function and then call another function from within it. What is this process called?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: \n",
    "This process is called \"Nested Functions\" or \"Function Nesting.\" In SQL, you can call one function from within another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example using SQL Server syntax:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- First Function\n",
    "CREATE FUNCTION AddTwoNumbers (@Num1 INT, @Num2 INT)\n",
    "RETURNS INT\n",
    "AS\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    RETURN (@Num1 + @Num2)\n",
    "END;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Second Function that calls the first function\n",
    "CREATE FUNCTION AddThreeNumbers (@Num1 INT, @Num2 INT, @Num3 INT)\n",
    "RETURNS INT\n",
    "AS\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    RETURN dbo.AddTwoNumbers(@Num1, @Num2) + @Num3\n",

    "**Question**: How to inspect the query's execution plan?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: \n",
    "The execution plan can usually be inspected through the database management system's (DBMS) user interface or by using specific SQL statements. In SQL Server, you can enable the execution plan from the toolbar, or use `SET SHOWPLAN ON` before running the query. In Oracle, you might use `EXPLAIN PLAN FOR <your_query>`.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: What is the purpose of the MAXDOP and recompiling keywords in SQL queries?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **MAXDOP**: Stands for \"Maximum Degree of Parallelism\". It controls the number of processors that are used for the execution of a query. You can set it for specific queries or as a server-wide setting. It helps in optimizing the query performance.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT * FROM Employees\n",
    "  OPTION (MAXDOP 4);\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RECOMPILE**: This keyword suggests the query optimizer to discard the stored execution plan and recompile a new execution plan. It is used when the query execution plan is suboptimal due to changes in data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT * FROM Employees\n",
    "  WHERE DepartmentID = @DepartmentID\n",
    "  OPTION (RECOMPILE);\n",

    "**Question**: How to build DDL statements from an existing database table, write steps for it?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: \n",
    "The process varies from one DBMS to another. In SQL Server, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Right-click on the database.\n",
    "2. Choose \"Tasks.\"\n",
    "3. Choose \"Generate Scripts.\"\n",
    "4. Follow the wizard and select the tables for which you want to generate DDL.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Oracle, you might use the `DBMS_METADATA.GET_DDL` function.\n",

    "**Question**: How to update data in a table using an inner join, write an example?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: \n",
    "Here is an example SQL statement to update a table using an inner join.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "UPDATE Orders\n",
    "SET Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID\n",

    "**Question**: Differentiate between truncate, delete, and drop with a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TRUNCATE**: Removes all rows from a table without logging the individual row deletions. Fast but cannot be rolled back.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **DELETE**: Removes rows from a table based on a condition. Slower because it logs individual row deletions, but can be rolled back.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  DELETE FROM Employees WHERE DepartmentID = 1;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **DROP**: Removes the table schema along with its data, indexes, triggers, and constraints. Cannot be rolled back.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  DROP TABLE Employees;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "TRUNCATE and DROP are faster but less safe compared to DELETE, which is slower but can be more precisely controlled and can be rolled back.\n",
