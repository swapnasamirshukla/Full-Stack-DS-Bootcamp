    "\n",
    "Learning can be affected as models may struggle to learn from incomplete\n",
    "data, leading to biased or less accurate results. Missing data can also\n",
    "introduce noise or distort patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Missing Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Removing Rows: If missing data is small, remove affected rows.\n",

    "**i. What is the IQR? What criteria are used to assess it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- IQR (Interquartile Range) is the range between the 25th and 75th\n",
    "percentiles in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- It helps identify outliers and assesses the spread of data. Outliers\n",

    "\\- A box plot consists of a box (interquartile range), a horizontal line\n",
    "(median), and two whiskers (minimum and maximum values within a certain\n",
    "range).\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- The lower whisker may surpass the upper whisker when the data\n",
    "distribution is skewed, causing a longer tail on the lower side.\n",

    "\\- The gap between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third\n",
    "quartile (75th percentile) in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- It's a measure of the spread or variability of data within the middle\n",
    "50% range.\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. Use a cross-tab:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Cross-tabulation shows the relationship between two categorical\n",
    "variables.\n",

    "1\\. Data with nominal and ordinal values:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Nominal values have no inherent order (e.g., colors).\n",
    "\n",

    "school \\< bachelor's \\< master's).\n",

    "\n",
    "\\- Histogram displays the frequency distribution of a continuous\n",
