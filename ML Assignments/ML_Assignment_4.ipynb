    "machine learning modeling?**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\\- Train-Test Split: Divide the dataset into training and testing\n",
    "subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Model Selection: Choose a suitable algorithm or model.\n",
    "\n",

    "**2. What are the different forms of data used in machine learning? Give\n",
    "a specific example for each of them.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Numerical Data: Data represented by numbers. Example: Temperature\n",
    "readings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Categorical Data: Data represented by categories or labels. Example:\n",
    "Types of fruits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Ordinal Data: Categorical data with a meaningful order. Example:\n",
    "Education levels (high school, college, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Text Data: Natural language text. Example: Customer reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Image Data: Pixel values representing images. Example: Medical scans.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Time Series Data: Data collected over time intervals. Example: Stock\n",
    "prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Distinguish:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Numeric vs. categorical attributes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Numeric attributes represent quantities and can be measured. Example:\n",
    "Age.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Categorical attributes represent categories or labels. Example:\n",
    "Gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Feature selection vs. dimensionality reduction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Feature selection chooses relevant features from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Dimensionality reduction reduces the number of features while\n",
    "preserving important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Make quick notes on any two of the following:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. The histogram:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of\n",
    "data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- It consists of bins (intervals) on the x-axis and frequency/count on\n",
    "the y-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. Use a scatter plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- A scatter plot displays data points as individual dots on a 2D graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- It shows the relationship between two numerical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Why is it necessary to investigate data? Is there a discrepancy in\n",
    "how qualitative and quantitative data are explored?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Investigating data helps identify patterns, outliers, and\n",
    "relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Qualitative data (categorical) is explored using frequency tables and\n",
    "charts, while quantitative data (numeric) is analyzed with histograms\n",
    "and statistical measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. What are the various histogram shapes? What exactly are â€˜bins'?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Histogram shapes include normal (bell-shaped), skewed (positively or\n",
    "negatively), and multimodal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Bins are intervals on the x-axis of a histogram that group data\n",
    "points. The height of each bin represents the frequency/count of data\n",
    "points in that interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. How do we deal with data outliers?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Outliers can be handled by removing them, transforming them, or\n",
    "capping/extending them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Techniques like Z-score, IQR (Interquartile Range), and box plots\n",
    "help identify outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. What are the various central inclination measures? Why does the\n",
    "mean vary too much from the median in certain data sets?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Central inclination measures include mean, median, and mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- The mean varies from the median in skewed datasets because outliers\n",
    "disproportionately affect the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. Describe how a scatter plot can be used to investigate bivariate\n",
    "relationships. Is it possible to find outliers using a scatter plot?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- A scatter plot shows how two variables are related by plotting their\n",
    "values as points.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Outliers can often be identified in a scatter plot as points far from\n",
    "the main cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. Describe how cross-tabs can be used to figure out how two\n",
    "variables are related.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- Cross-tabs (cross-tabulation) are used to analyze the relationship\n",
    "between two categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- They present the frequency distribution of the two variables in a\n",
    "table format, revealing patterns and associations."
