    "**2. In the sense of machine learning, explain the \"No Free Lunch\"\n",
    "theorem.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"No Free Lunch\" theorem in machine learning states that no single\n",
    "algorithm can perform best on all possible problems. It implies that the\n",
    "superiority of a particular algorithm on a specific problem is balanced\n",
    "by its limitations on other problems. In essence, there's no universally\n",
    "superior algorithm; the choice of algorithm depends on the problem's\n",
    "characteristics.\n",

    "**3. Describe the K-fold cross-validation mechanism in detail.**\n",
    "\n",
    "K-fold cross-validation is a technique to assess a model's performance\n",
    "by dividing the dataset into K subsets (folds). The process involves\n",
    "these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. The dataset is divided into K subsets of roughly equal size.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. For each fold, the model is trained on K-1 folds and tested on the\n",
    "remaining fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. This process is repeated K times, with each fold acting as the test\n",
    "set once.\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. The performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, RMSE) are averaged across\n",
    "the K iterations to evaluate the model's overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Describe the bootstrap sampling method. What is the aim of it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The bootstrap sampling method involves creating multiple random samples\n",
    "(with replacement) from the original dataset. The aim is to estimate the\n",
    "sampling distribution of a statistic or measure (like mean or standard\n",
    "deviation) and infer population characteristics. It helps quantify\n",
    "uncertainty and assess the reliability of statistical estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. What is the significance of calculating the Kappa value for a\n",
    "classification model? Demonstrate how to measure the Kappa value of a\n",
    "classification model using a sample collection of results.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kappa value, also known as Cohen's Kappa, measures the agreement\n",
    "between the observed and expected classifications in a classification\n",
    "model. It considers the possibility of agreements occurring by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula for Kappa:\n",
    "\n",
    "Kappa = (Agreement - Chance Agreement) / (Total Agreement - Chance\n",
    "Agreement)\n",

    "| Actual Positive | FN                 | TP                 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Kappa = (TN + TP - (FP + FN)) / (TN + TP + FP + FN)\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Describe the model ensemble method. In machine learning, what part\n",
    "does it play?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The ensemble method involves combining multiple models (base learners)\n",
    "to create a stronger, more accurate model. It plays a crucial role in\n",
    "improving predictive performance, reducing overfitting, and handling\n",
    "complex data. Examples include Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and\n",
    "Bagging.\n",
