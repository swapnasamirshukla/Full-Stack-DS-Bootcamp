    "**Question 1: Define the Bayesian interpretation of probability.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The Bayesian interpretation of probability views probability as\n",
    "a measure of uncertainty that reflects an individual's subjective\n",
    "beliefs about the likelihood of events. It involves updating prior\n",
    "beliefs using new evidence to form posterior beliefs through Bayes'\n",
    "theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2: Define the probability of a union of two events with an\n",
    "equation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The probability of the union of two events A and B is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)−P(A∩B)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 3: What is joint probability? What is its formula?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Joint probability is the likelihood of two or more events\n",
    "occurring simultaneously. It measures the probability of the\n",
    "intersection of events A and B, denoted as P(A∩B).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 4: What is the chain rule of probability?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The chain rule of probability is used to express the joint\n",
    "probability of multiple events in terms of conditional probabilities.\n",
    "For events A, B, and C: P(A∩B∩C)=P(A)⋅P(B∣A)⋅P(C∣A∩B)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 5: What is conditional probability mean? What is the formula\n",
    "for it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Conditional probability measures the likelihood of an event B\n",
    "occurring given that event A has occurred. The formula is: P(B/A)=\n",
    "P(A∩B)/P(A)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 6: What are continuous random variables?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Continuous random variables can take any value within a range.\n",
    "They have a continuous probability distribution, often represented by\n",
    "probability density functions (PDFs).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 7: What are Bernoulli distributions? What is the formula for\n",
    "it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Bernoulli distributions model a binary outcome (success or\n",
    "failure) with a parameter p as the probability of success. The formula\n",
    "for the probability of a success is:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X=1) = p\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X=0) = 1-p\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 8: What is a binomial distribution? What is the formula for\n",
    "it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The binomial distribution describes the number of successes in a\n",
    "fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials. It has parameters n(number\n",
    "of trials) and p (probability of success in each trial). The formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X=k) = nCk p^k (1-p)^n-k\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 9: What is Poisson distribution? What is the formula for\n",
    "it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The Poisson distribution models the number of events occurring\n",
    "in a fixed interval of time or space. It has a parameter λ (average rate\n",
    "of events). The formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X=k) = (e^- λ) \\* (λ^k)/k!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 10: Define covariance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Covariance measures the degree to which two random variables\n",
    "change together. It indicates the direction of the linear relationship\n",
    "between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 11: Define correlation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Correlation quantifies the strength and direction of the linear\n",
    "relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, with 0\n",
    "indicating no linear correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 12: Define sampling with replacement. Give an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Sampling with replacement involves selecting items from a\n",
    "population and returning each item before the next selection. Example:\n",
    "Drawing cards from a deck and putting the card back before drawing\n",
    "again.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 13: What is sampling without replacement? Give an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Sampling without replacement involves selecting items without\n",
    "returning them to the population. Example: Drawing cards from a deck\n",
    "without putting them back before drawing again.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 14: What is a hypothesis? Give an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: A hypothesis is a statement or assumption about a population or\n",
    "phenomenon that can be tested using data. Example: \"The new drug reduces\n",
    "symptoms more effectively than the current treatment.\""
